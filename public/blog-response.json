      "blog_body": "It’s hard to explain the engineering marvel that is the SR-71 Blackbird. A long-range plane capable of flying 26 kilometers above the surface of the planet. So high that the pilots could see the curvature on the planet and the inky black of space from their cockpits. It flew so fast that the engineers had to develop entirely new materials and designs to mitigate and dissipate the heat generated from aerodynamic friction. Unique engines were needed to function from 0 up to Mach 3.2, dealing with a myriad of problems like cooling, fuel efficiency, and supersonic shock waves interfering with airflow. A plane so advanced that when it detected a surface-to-air missile its response was simply to change course and speed up. Even though the missiles had a higher top speed, they couldn’t achieve the range and high altitude maneuverability the Blackbird could. A speed at which the SR-71 could cruise for extended periods.\r\n\r\n![aerodynamics](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1.max-800x600.png)\r\n\r\nHow on earth did it manage that? To achieve those kinds of speeds a ramjet is typically needed. A ramjet, as you can probably guess from the name, relies on ram pressure to operate. Ram Pressure is simply the pressure that occurs as a plane rams itself through the air. So, as the engine moves through the sky, it funnels this high-pressure air inside. Before entering the combustion chamber the supersonic airflow must first be slowed down. This acts as the compressor stage of a normal jet engine, elevating the air pressure before it enters the combustion chamber. Once the air enters the combustion chamber, It is mixed with fuel and ignited. It expands and accelerates once again out of the exit nozzle. With no moving parts, this type of engine is capable of flying at speeds far greater than a typical turbine-driven engine, but it cannot start from zero. It needs forward movement to achieve the correct compression of air in the combustion chamber. So, they are either dropped from a conventional plane, have a secondary propulsion system, or are a hybrid of a conventional jet engine and a ramjet, which is precisely what the SR-71 used.\r\n\r\nThe turbojet J58 engine of the SR-71 is nestled inside the nacelle here. In front and around The J58 is a complicated system of airflow management. These control mechanisms allow the propulsion system to transition from a primarily turbojet engine to a ramjet engine in mid-flight\r\n\r\nFirst, the inlet spike. It is capable of moving forward and back by 0.66 meters. This adjusts the inlet and the throat area, which controls the airflow entering the engine. It also keeps the position of the normal shock wave at its ideal position between the inlet throat and the compressor, this is the most efficient position for the shock wave, as it minimizes the energy lost due to drag as air flows over the shock wave. The inlet spike stays in the forward position until Mach 1.6. After this point, it begins to move backward by 41 millimeters forever 0.1 increase in Mach number. Keeping the shock wave in its ideal position. The inlet spike contains perforations that connect to the outside of the nacelle through ducts. Initially, the flow of air will come from the outside in to provide additional airflow to the turbojet engines, but once the plane hits about Mach 0.5 this airflow reverses. As the plane speeds up the inlet spike develops a significant boundary layer of air. A boundary layer is a layer of very slow-moving air that clings to the surface of objects. By bleeding this layer of slow-moving air off to the inlet spike it frees up a greater area of the inlet area for high energy fast-moving air, and thus improves efficiency. Around the engine, there is a bypass area, which takes air from the inlet and bypasses it is around the J58 engine. This air was used to cool the J58, which again improved engine efficiency and allowed the plane to fly faster. After the air passes the engine it rejoins the airflow just after the engine afterburner, adding additional thrust as more oxygen becomes available for combustion and increases the pressure through the ejector nozzle. Air got into this bypass area in several ways. There was a shock trap, otherwise known as the cowl bleed, located here, which again helped minimize boundary layer growth. There were stuck-in doors, located here, which opened only from Mach 0 to Mach 0.5, to add additional air to the bypass for engine cooling.",

      "blog_body": "The CPU has had a revolutionary phase backed up with many challenges to become what it looks like today. During the initial 2000s, when the fight for performance was at its peak, AMD and Intel were contending as the frontrunners. At first, increasing clock speed posed a major threat which lasted for quite a while and didn't require much effort. However, due to the laws of physics, this rapid growth had to reach its end.\r\n\r\nAccording to Moore's Law, the number of transistors on a chip had to be doubled every 24 months. Processors had to become smaller to accommodate more transistors, which would mean better performance. However, the resultant increase in temperature would depend on massive cooling. Therefore, the race for speed soon changed its trajectory to be the fight against the laws of physics. Though, the solution to this problem didn't take much of a cost. Instead of increasing clock speeds, producers now introduce multiple-core chips, where each core had the exact same clock speed because of which computers could now be more effective in performing multiple tasks during the same intervals.\r\n\r\n![SPACE](https://tetragram.codered.cloud/media/images/1.max-800x600_Mr08U9t.png)\r\n\r\nThe strategy ultimately prevailed but it came along with some drawbacks. The introduction of multiple cores needed developers to introduce different algorithms so that the improvements could be observable. Now, this didn't come quite easy in the gaming world where the CPU's performance had always been a prime characteristic. Another issue was that the more cores you have, operating them becomes harder.\r\n\r\nIt was also difficult to come up with an efficient code that would function with all the cores. If there was a possibility to develop a 150 GHz single- core unit, it would've been the ideal machine. However, silicon chips cannot be clocked up that fast due to the laws of physics. And this started to raise possibilities of replacing silicon in the processor industry.",
